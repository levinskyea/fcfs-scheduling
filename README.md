# Required Software

NetBeans IDE runs on the J2SE JDK 5.0 (JavaTM 2 JDK, Standard Edition), which consists of the Java Runtime Environment plus developer tools for compiling, debugging, and running applications written in the JavaTM language. NetBeans IDE 5.0 also runs on J2SE SDK version 1.4.2, but it has only been tested on JDK 5.0.

>Note: If you wish to run the IDE on earlier versions of the SDK or if you prefer to install the IDE manually, you can download archived versions of the IDE at http://java.sun.com/products/archive/index.html.
